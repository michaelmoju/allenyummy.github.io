Hi, I'm a Software Engineer which aims to utilize state-of-the-art techniques of natural language processing to build up scenario-based financial services at Data Intelligence R&D Division, CTBC Bank, Co., Ltd. My research interest covers deep learning technique for natural language processing. Occasionally, I will share some notes and articles related to AI papers, software, and algorithms. Thanks for reading and take the time to leave a comment.

I've graduated from Dept. Bio-Industrial Mechatronics Engineering at National Taiwan University. I was a research assistant for natural language processing in [Natural Language Understanding Lab](http://nlul.iis.sinica.edu.tw) supervised by [Keh-Yih Su](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/kysu/index_zh.html) in Institute of Information Science, Sinica, before serving as a soldier. I planned to study a PhD program abroad; however, I changed my original mind during Covid19 was raging the world and I kept thinking my own future. Two months after the end of the military service, I then decided to work and try my abilities. At this time, I still did not give up the idea of going abroad to study PhD. Instead, I actively prepare for English exams and submit papers to top international conference to test my ability and energy for independent research. Eventually, after I got rejected of my submission, I found that I didn't take it for pleasure, and I couldn't imagine myself devoting all my energy and time to research in the future. The opportunity cost was so great that I couldn't dream of it. At the same time, I also found that I like to research at my own pace. Therefore, I decided to become one of the few developmental researchers in the workplace to explore my sense of accomplishment.

I'm still looking forward to new job oppotunities. Here is my [resume](https://allenyummy.github.io/resume/cv.pdf). If you're interested in me, please send letter to chiangyulun0914@gmail.com and I'll respond as soon as possible.

Hi, 我是一位軟體工程師，目前任職於中國信託商業銀行 數據暨科技研發處，嘗試以自然語言處理技術建立金融場景服務。我的研究興趣涵蓋應用於自然語言處理的深度學習技術，偶爾分享與論文、軟體、刷題相關的小品文章。感謝閱讀，並花時間留下評論。

我畢業於國立臺灣大學生物機電工程學系與研究所，當兵前夕半年空窗期，於中央研究院資訊科學研究所[蘇克毅](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/kysu/index_zh.html)研究所的[自然語言理解實驗室](http://nlul.iis.sinica.edu.tw)任職研究助理，初嚐自然語言處理領域。原先規劃出國攻博，恰逢2020年新冠肺炎肆虐世界，且在探索自己的過程中不斷衝撞自己的想法，在兵役結束後兩個月，決定投身職場試試自己的能耐，但是，此時的我仍未放棄出國攻博的念頭，反而積極準備英文考試、投稿國際頂尖研討會，測試自己獨立研究能力與能量。最後，在一次投稿失利之際，發現自己並不以此為樂，無法想像自己精力全投身於研究當中，機會成本大到令我難以嚮往未來，卻也在此時，我也發現自己喜歡按照自己的步調去做研究，因此，我改變自己原先的想法，決定成為職場中少數的開發研究者，探尋自己的成就感。

同時，我也持續尋找新的工作機會，這裡放上我的[履歷](https://allenyummy.github.io/resume/cv.pdf)，若對我有興趣的話，請寄信至 chiangyulun0914@gmail.com ，我會儘速回應。
